relational operators

## some basic concepts
    x == 5      # comparison operator  value is being compared if x is equal to 5 or not
    x = 5       # 5 is assigned to x

    x == 5 and y == 6         # x should be equal to 5 and y should also be equal to 6
    x == 5 or y == 6          # either of x and y can be equal to 5 and 6 respectively
    x == 5 and not y == 6     # x should be equal to 5 but y should not be equal to 6



    >, <, >=, <=, !=, ==              # Comparison Operators or Relational operator

    + , - , * , / , % , **, //        # Arithmetic Operators

    = , +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **= , &=, |= , ^= , >>= , <<=       # Assignment Operators

    and , or, not                     # Logical Operators

    is , is not                       # Identity Operators

    in , not in                       # Membership Operators

    & , | , ^ , ~ , << , >>           # Bitwise Operators
